Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing
Used EDA for the given data of Housing Prices so that further insights can be drawn from this data. Here I have done data wrangling, central tendency of the data, finding and filling missing values, detection of Outliers and itâ€™s removal, along with correlation of the final data with eachother.
This correlation shows the price dependecy of the houses based on some variables
**e.g.:-**
(1) House having new age of property, means house construct and sold within 20 years of construction have better and high prices 
(2) House having total 7-10 rooms, 1 kitchen, 1-2 Full Bathrooms and shape of property Regular/Slightly Irregular
(3) House having total living area between 1500-2500 sqr ft, size of garage 500-800 sqr ft.
(4) Having Garage attached to home, 2-3 car parking capacity, Average quality and   condition of garage
